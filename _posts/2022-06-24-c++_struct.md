## Flexible Array Members in a structure in C

Flexible Array Members in a structure in C, is not took into account for the size of the struct. For example, as the following code shows:

```c
struct student {
   int stud_id;
   int name_len;
   int struct_size;
   char stud_name[];
};

struct teacher {
    char teacher_name[];
};
// The sizeof(struct student) is 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 12
// There will be a compile error for the teacher
// struct, which is 
// "flexible array member in a struct with no named members"
```
